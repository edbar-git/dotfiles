## Setting up wallpapers and lockscreen
The scripts are setup to look for wallpapers and lockscreen images within your `~/Pictures/wallpapers/` and  `~/Pictures/lockscreens/` directories. If you don't have them, create and populate them with your prefered images, then restart your environment. If you still don't have any wallpapers selected, choose one in Nitrogen or press `Mod + b` to run the script for changing wallpapers.
